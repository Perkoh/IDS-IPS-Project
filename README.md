# IDS/IPS Project

## Objective

This project focuses on implementing an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) using Suricata. Suricata is an open-source network threat detection engine capable of real-time intrusion detection (IDS), intrusion prevention (IPS), and network security monitoring (NSM). This project demonstrates how to set up, configure, and utilize Suricata to detect and prevent potential network threats in a simulated environment.

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to install and configure Suricata on a Linux-based system, tailoring it to meet specific network security requirements.
- Developed skills in managing Suricata's rulesets, including downloading, updating, and creating custom rules to detect and prevent specific threats.
- Understood how Suricata uses signature-based detection to identify known threats, and learn how to customize rules to improve detection accuracy.
- Gained hands-on experience with Intrusion Prevention techniques, including how to configure Suricata to actively block or mitigate detected threats.
- Developed skills in collecting, managing, and analyzing logs generated by Suricata, which are crucial for identifying and understanding security incidents.

### Tools Used

- Suricata
